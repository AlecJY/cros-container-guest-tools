PipeWire helper for ChromiumOS integration
 This package installs customized pipewire and pipewire-pulse configurations
 to /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d and /etc/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf.d.
 The custom configurations are:
  * Set a higher minimum buffer size to avoid audio glitches.
  * Load audio sink and source manually because of the lack of udev.
